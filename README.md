# Introduction
## Framework
The dictionary consists of words and phrases (**Lexemes**). At the lowest level, lexical variants (_pass phrase_ and _password_) or very similar in meaning (_security gap_ and _secuirty hole_) are grouped into **Terms**. Each term is assigned to 1 of 4 **Domains**: Cyber Security (e.g. _hacker, password_), Security (e.g., _safety, danger_), Cyber (e.g., _mobile phone, user_), and General (_company, child_). Terms are further grouped into the broader **Concepts** to which they relate (e.g., the **Terms** _Exploit_ and _Security Flaw_ are grouped under the **Concept** _Vulnerability_. Concepts are assigned to 1 of several categories, nested within 2 over-arching dimensions--Security and Context--which can be thought of as separate dictionaries. The **Security Categories** are: 'Cybersecurity', 'Security Actor', 'Security General','Security Mechanism','Threat Actor','Threat General','Threat Mechanism'. The **Context Categories** are: 'Activity', 'Cyber Entity', 'Individual', 'Org', 'Quality'.
