## TACS

Text Analysis tool for the Cyber Security domain (TACS) consists of an open-source dictionary `csd.csv`, or codebook, of ca. 700 words and phrases related to cyber security, organised into concepts (e.g., Hacking, Passwords, User) and grouped into overarching categories (e.g., Threat Mechanisms, Security Mechanisms, Cyber Entities), alongside a set of functions `tacs.py` to apply the dictionary codes to textual data and perform numeric transformations and queries.
