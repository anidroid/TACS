    "The dictionary consists of words and phrases (**Lexemes**). At the lowest level, lexical variants (_pass phrase_ and _password_) or very similar in meaning (_security gap_ and _secuirty hole_) are grouped into **Terms**. Each term is assigned to 1 of 4 **Domains**: Cyber Security (e.g. _hacker, password_), Security (e.g., _safety, danger_), Cyber (e.g., _mobile phone, user_), and General (_company, child_). Terms are further grouped into the broader **Concepts** to which they relate (e.g., the **Terms** _Exploit_ and _Security Flaw_ are grouped under the **Concept** _Vulnerability_. Concepts are assigned to 1 of several categories, nested within 2 over-arching dimensions--Security and Context--which can be thought of as separate dictionaries. The **Security Categories** are: 'Cybersecurity', 'Security Actor', 'Security General','Security Mechanism','Threat Actor','Threat General','Threat Mechanism'. The **Context Categories** are: 'Activity', 'Cyber Entity', 'Individual', 'Org', 'Quality'. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first step in all TACS operations is to preprocess and tag the documents. During this step, documents are segmented into individual units called tokens (words, phrases, punctuation marks, etc.) using `spacy`. A spacy document is a list of tokens, which have various attributes (e.g., part-of-speach tags `tok.pos_`, lemmatised versions `tok.lemma_`). TACS categories are specified in a custom attribute `._.csd`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tagging is performed using the `tacs_tag()` function. This is the slowest process in TACS and it is therefore recommended to call the tagging function once on all documents, save the output as a separate object (e.g., `tokdocs`) or a column in the dataframe, and use it as input for the remaining TACS functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining TACS functions will first check whether the data provided as input contains documents that are already tagged. If not, the function will look for full-text documents and process them (this will take time). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Context-aware tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "The function attempts to tag non-cybersecurity terms only if they appear in the context/vicinity of cybersecurity. Currently, context is determined by a simple rule: A non-cs term is only tagged if its `n` neighbouring terms contain one cybersecurity term or (one cyber and one security term) `cs|(c&s)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Context-aware tagging can be disabled or adjusted with the following parameters:\n",
    "- `context_rule`: Default is `cs|(c&s)`: tag word if nearby terms include at least one cyber-security word or one cyber and one security word. The default rule can be replaced with a more conservative version where neighbours must include a cybersecurity term `c&s`. `False` to disable altogether: every dictionary lexeme is tagged regardless of context.\n",

       " Another example is LogonHealth 's online prescription- filling system. Through this, doctors can\" write\" and pre- adjudicate an electronic prescription from the examination room and send it directly to a patient 's pharmacy via a wireless Palm- like device or Internet- connected desktop. During this process, the physician can also check a database for patient drug allergies, reactions to other drugs the patient is taking, and even what medications the patient 's medical insurance will cover. \n",
       " LogonHealth relies on PKI to control access to their system and to quickly and strongly authenticate doctors and pharmacy identity when writing and fulfilling prescriptions<span class=\"tacstok\">&nbsp online </span><sub>  Internet  </sub>&nbsp. PKI<span class=\"tacstok\">&nbsp digital_certificates </span><sub>  Access Control  </sub>&nbsp provide LogonHealth with the confidence that their<span class=\"tacstok\">&nbsp users </span><sub>  User  </sub>&nbsp are who they say they are, avoiding the security weaknesses of a<span class=\"tacstok\">&nbsp user_name </span><sub>  Asset  </sub>&nbsp and<span class=\"tacstok\">&nbsp password </span><sub>  Password  </sub>&nbsp access system.

    "## Query\n",
    "\n",
    "The query function returns documents or sentences in which certain TACS categories appear. Queries can be specified using category keys (e.g. 'tttp') or labels (e.g. 'Threat Mechanisms) linked through AND and OR operators. For example `Mobile Devices AND ttp` would look for sentences (or documents where both of these categories are mentioned). By default, documents are split into sentences `qsents=True` and each sentence is queried indiviudally; if this is disabled, full documents are queried. Currently, query returns True if the specified condition is met at least once. Future iterations might implement an option to specify a custom threshold, e.g., Mobile Device mentioned > 3. As per the Annotation function, TACS terms appear in bold with categories as subscripts; the output can be saved and/or displayed in a Jupyter Notebook. Currently, only HTML annotation is supported. Future versions can implement a DOCX variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- **Data**: The result of the query can be returned and/or saved as a table, with one searched units (documents or sentences) per rows and column for query outcome (True, i.e., condition met, or False). The id and full text of the unit are included. Selected via `save_data=False`.\n",
    "- **Annotated documents**: The queried documents are returned in full. If sentences are queried separately, sentences matching the query are highlighted. Selected via `return_all=True`.\n",
    "- **Segments**: Documents are returned as an itemised list of sentences matching the query. Selected via `return_all=False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `data`: Object containing TACS or plain text documents (single document, list, dataframe). If no TACS documents are present, tacs_tag is called on plain text documents. In a dataframe, plain text documents should be located in a column labelled 'text' or the column label should be specifed via `textcol`.\n",
    "- `query`: A string specifying a query of TACS entities, specified with full or partial labels (e.g. Protection) or keys (e.g. 'tttp'), and linked with the operators AND and OR.\n",
    "- `qsents`: True/False. If True, documents are segmented into sentences and the queruy is performed on sentence-level.\n",
    "- `return_all`: True/False. If True, the full document is returned and query outcome is indicated via highlights in annotated documents or a boolean _query_ variable in data. If False, only matching documents/sentences are returned.\n",
    "- `data_return`: If True, the function returns a dataframe with the query outcome.\n",
    "- `data_save`: If True, the query outcome dataframe is written to disk under the name _tacsq__{query}_\n",
    "- `annot_return`: If True and if using a Jupyter Notebook, the annotated documents will be displayed in the notebook. Not recommended for large data.\n",
    "- `annot_save`: If True, annotated documents will be saved to disk in the form of a single document, individual documents separated by headers.\n",
    "- `annot_markup`: Specifies markup language for the annotation. Currently only `html` is implemented.\n",
    "- `annot_level`: Specifies the level of categorisation displayed in the annotation. Default is 'Concept'."

       "<style>.tacstok{font-weight:bold}</style> Continued industry consolidation, a softening property/ casualty market and the never- ending search for new business opportunities also trigged conversation at the event.<style>.tacstok{font-weight:bold}</style> Of course, concern remains on how the insurance industry, on the underwriting and brokerage sides, can attract the talent it needs( see story, page 40), said attendees. \n",

       "<style>.tacstok{font-weight:bold}</style>\" Nobody really knows the right pricing for cyber,\" said Robert Cohen, chairman and CEO of Denver- based IMA Financial Group Inc. and newly elected vice chairman of the council. \n",
       "<style>.tacstok{font-weight:bold}</style> Despite questions, brokers continue to look for ways to expand cyber coverage.<style>.tacstok{font-weight:bold}</style> For example, Mr. Hylant said his brokerage is offering<span class=\"tacstok\">&nbsp cyber </span><sub>  Technology  </sub>&nbsp coverage on every renewal. \n",
