0,pq_cs_newsp_260,cs media newspapers," WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the high-tech equivalent of a thief burglarizing police headquarters, a hacker using an unusually clever tactic vandalized a prominent Internet site devoted to computer security.
The electronic assault against the AntiOnline site last week occurred days after other hackers altered the Web site for Symantec Corp., whose software is used by millions of consumers to protect against viruses and electronic snoops.
In the latest incident, a hacker using an Internet account in Russia successfully tricked the site's computer to load hidden software code from elsewhere onto one of its own Web pages, called ""Eye on the Underground.""
The site was fixed just over an hour later, but this week's attacks raised questions about Internet security: If organizations that clearly are aware of potential security problems can't protect their sites, how can the rest of the Internet?
""There is no absolute security,"" said James Adams, chief executive of Infrastructure Defense Inc., which works to protect companies against hackers. ""All you can do is try to keep ahead of the game. For anybody to claim they're totally secure, it's not true.""
Although the hacker never directly infiltrated AntiOnline's computers, the hidden code redirected visitors to a Web page with the image of an unblinking eye along with the message ""expensive security systems do not protect from stupidity.""
""I wouldn't call it sophisticated, but I'd call it clever,"" said John Vranesevich, who runs AntiOnline in Beaver, Pa.
The affected AntiOnline page was designed to automatically collect and display messages posted to an online discussion group at another Internet site popular among hackers.
But someone using the Internet account traced to Russia slipped hidden computer code into the text of one of those messages, which was then automatically loaded onto AntiOnline's site and sabotaged it.
Mr. Adams said Web sites specializing in computer security need to take greater precautions because successful attacks against these computers can carry greater glory among the underground-hacking community. ""There are brownie points to be gained,"" Mr. Adams said.
""Do we need better education? Yes,"" said Russ Cooper of NTBugtraq, a popular Internet discussion group about computer security. ""Do we need better tools? Yes. Does that mean I'm never going to suffer an attack? No.
""There isn't a piece of software you double-click to set up and it's secure,"" he said. ""You have to have staff and policy, and you have to have monitoring.""
Mr. Vranesevich, who was demonized by some hackers when he announced over the summer that AntiOnline would help authorities trace and prosecute computer attacks, noted that other Web site operators weren't as vulnerable to the same technique that affected his site.
""We sort of caused it ourselves,"" he said. ""We visit the hacker sites dynamically, and that is the type of scenario your average system administrator probably wouldn't encounter. We're doing things far more obscure.""

1,pq_cs_tradej_675,cs media tradejournals,"Headnote Creative and comprehensive ways to meet security needs.
In the coming months, healthcare organizations are required to implement strong data security mechanisms to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). From a business perspective, these organizations must also choose an information security and user authentication method that provides interoperability, scalability and ease of implementation.
One alternative for user authentication is biometrics, although it doesn't allow users to digitally ""sign"" documents, making biometric devices insufficient for allowing organizations to attach nonrefutable signatures to electronic transactions and sensitive emails. Also, biometrics works best in controlled IT environments, such as LANs, because of the special hardware needed for biometric authentication systems, which become unmanageable when transacting with external users (outside the LAN).
Organizations need easy-to-deploy software that gives them the authentication power of biometrics combined with a digital signature capability.
Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a system where a person's online identity is validated by a digital certificate. Within the healthcare arena, certificates can be issued to healthcare professionals and plan members through a healthcare organization's certificate authority (CA), which determines who should receive a certificate, for how long the certificate will remain active, and what access privileges that certificate holder is authorized to have.
Certificates are then presented as proof of identity to reliant applications before access is granted to authorized information. These same digital certificates can be used to generate digital signatures. Depending on an organization's needs, a PKI can also be run via an application service provider (ASP), which allows healthcare organizes tions to quickly establish a strong authentication security system without having to purchase and manage the software themselves.
Risk of Data Theft
Health data is becoming more Internet-browser-accessible, and therefore healthcare organizations and patients are becoming increasingly susceptible to data theft and prying eyes. Compounding this threat is the advent of Internetbased consultation, which entails sending sensitive medical information over the Internet via e-mail and Web services. Unfortunately, e-mail can be insecure and intentionally or unintentionally intercepted, incorrectly routed, or even worse, altered en route by a third party and ushered on to the unsuspecting recipient.
In a similar vein, as patient-identifiable health information is posted on websites or stored in databases for access by remote users, people trying to gain illegal access to confidential data need only steal or generate a valid user name and password to gain access to information on potentially thousands of patients. These scenarios present serious information security problems for today's healthcare information professionals. But these are problems that PKI can often remedy.
Access Control
Increasingly, healthcare and related organizations are storing patient health information in such central locations as Web servers or Internet-connected databases. While centrally stored data allows medical practitioners and associated personnel realtime remote access to crucial patient information, keeping these sites secure is a challenge.
PKI helps keep patient information secure by allowing organizations to implement access control, maintain data integrity and confidentiality, authenticate users and ensure non-repudiation. As a CA, a healthcare organization issues digital certificates to users that authenticate a person's online identity. When issuing the certificates, the CA administrator can configure who has access to which information. After this is done, a PKI-enabled application will understand which individuals are authorized to view and access multiple levels of secure data. Since most browsers and e-mail clients are already PKI-enabled, integrating certificates with Internet applications is quite easy.
For an in-house PKI model, an organization licenses the appropriate software from a PKI vendor, implements its own PKI and becomes its own CA. If funds and time are lacking, however, healthcare organizations can contract this out to an ASP, which can easily host and manage the PKI on their behalf. The ASP acts as the trusted CA and controls certificate issuance and revocation per its client's instructions.
Is Secure E-mail Possible?
Sending e-mail securely-that is, assuring the sender and recipient that the integrity of transmitted information is maintained and that it has not been intercepted, misrouted or changed-is also a concern in the healthcare field. For physicians to quickly relay information over the Internet via email, a ""digital signature"" must be used. By implementing PKI for this application, medical personnel can send encrypted e-mail with confidence that the transmitted information is readable only by the intended recipient.
To send a secure e-mail within a PKI, the sender needs to retrieve the recipient's ""public key"" from a directory within his or her organization. After retrieving the key, the sender presses the ""encrypt"" button within the e-mail client and the message is automatically encrypted when sent to the recipient. Upon the e-mail's arrival, the recipient's ""private key"" (issued with his or her digital certificate) automatically decrypts the message, rendering it readable again.
The cost of implementing a PKI to secure data access and protect online transactions will vary depending on an organization's needs and size of deployment. Organizations should choose a solution that allows for the flexibility of future growth of the PKI. Xcert, for example, has recently independently tested its software to scale to 8 million users, ensuring that even the largest healthcare PKI deployments can be handled easily.
One must also consider that the PKI may need to evolve as an organization changes, including adding new users, departments, or divisions. An organization should implement a solution that does not require client-side software, which quickly becomes problematic when issuing certificates to outside business partners or members.
On the Horizon
Healthcare organizations can look to PKI for more than secure e-mail. Digital certificates are also finding a role in cutting-edge electronic healthcare technology. For example, Marconi Medical Systems, a picture archiving and communications system (PACS) vendor, is integrating PKI into its Web-based products. This will allow secure, remote retrieval of radiology images and reports via a standard Web browser and Internet connection. Marconi's PACS customers can issue certificates to their remote users to ensure that only authorized persons are accessing the database.
With this added security, remote physicians can securely access radiological images and diagnostic reports immediately after the radiologist makes the diagnosis. This type of system enables the practice of ""real-time radiology,"" expediting the information to only those who need to see it, without forcing undue hardware or software requirements on them at the same time.
Another example is LogonHealth's online prescription-filling system. Through this, doctors can ""write"" and pre-adjudicate an electronic prescription from the examination room and send it directly to a patient's pharmacy via a wireless Palm-like device or Internet-connected desktop. During this process, the physician can also check a database for patient drug allergies, reactions to other drugs the patient is taking, and even what medications the patient's medical insurance will cover.
LogonHealth relies on PKI to control access to their system and to quickly and strongly authenticate doctors and pharmacy identity when writing and fulfilling prescriptions online. PKI digital certificates provide LogonHealth with the confidence that their users are who they say they are, avoiding the security weaknesses of a user name and password access system. This strong authentication also helps prevent unauthorized people from sending in prescriptions.
Examples such as these illustrate the need for PKI in the healthcare arena, whether for securing transmitted data or allowing access to sensitive healthcare information data stores. Underlying this, though, HIPAA guidelines mandate that electronic transactions involving healthcare information must be secured through a comprehensive, interoperable and scalable security system, like one created through PKI. No matter what the application involved, the need for HIPAA compliance will undoubtedly usher PKI far into the health information market.

2,pq_cs_tradej_919,cs media tradejournals,"The changing nature of cyber liability is a key issue for insurance agents and brokers.
""Cyber is definitely the hot topic,"" said Richard Hylant, executive vice president of Toledo, Ohio-based Hylant Group.
""Cyber's on everyone's mind. It's an emerging and evolving risk,"" said Mike Foley, CEO of North America commercial and regional chairman of Zurich North America.
He said that as recently as two years ago, it was hard to get customers to think about cyber liability. Now, they are far more aware of their risks, he said.
But cyber was far from the sole area of discussion during the Washington-based Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers' Insurance Leadership Forum last week in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Continued industry consolidation, a softening property/casualty market and the never-ending search for new business opportunities also trigged conversation at the event. Of course, concern remains on how the insurance industry, on the underwriting and brokerage sides, can attract the talent it needs (see story, page 40), said attendees.
For underwriters and brokers, cyber presents opportunities and risks, participants said.
Cyber is ""the new EPL,"" Steve Brockmeyer, president and CEO of the Bolton Co. in Pasadena, California, and immediate past chairman of the council, said in referring to employment practices liability coverage.
Cyber is ""morphing a little bit,"" said Peter Gilbertson, executive vice president of Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA Inc. in Madison, New Jersey. He said the focus is shifting to third-party breaches, where ""soft damages"" such as anxiety over the breaches can win damages in court.
""The cyber catastrophe hasn't happened yet,"" said Mr. Gilbertson, referring to an infrastructure attack.
Cyber is one of the few places where there is premium growth for underwriters, said Ben Walter, CEO of Hiscox USA Inc. in New York. He said underwriters are trying to come to terms with risk aggregation issues.
""Nobody really knows the right pricing for cyber,"" said Robert Cohen, chairman and CEO of Denver-based IMA Financial Group Inc. and newly elected vice chairman of the council.
Despite questions, brokers continue to look for ways to expand cyber coverage. For example, Mr. Hylant said his brokerage is offering cyber coverage on every renewal.
Industry consolidation was another hot topic. Recent transactions such as the proposed acquisition of Chubb Corp. by Ace Ltd., Humana Inc. by Aetna Inc. and Towers Watson & Co. by Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. mean a change in market opportunities for brokers.
But consolidation discussions centered more on ""who's next"" than deals already announced, said Hank Watkins, president of Lloyd's America Inc. in New York.
The consolidations continue in a persistently softening property/casualty market.
Low interest rates, relatively benign losses and an abundance of capital are expected to keep pressure on prices for a long time, said Don Bailey, president of global sales at Marsh L.L.C. in New York.
""It's a relatively flat soft market with some softening,"" said Mr. Cohen. ""It's still line-by-line.""
""It's getting softer except for, maybe, auto,"" said Mark A. Miller, executive vice president and president of Hylant Group's Ann Arbor, Michigan, office.
During the second quarter, there was downward rate pressure, especially on large-layer property accounts and workers compensation, said Mr. Foley. He said insurers still need to maintain rates because of ongoing low interest rates.
Not surprisingly, brokers are considering new segments for growth.
""Mid-market is still the foundation,"" said Mr. Cohen. ""Our tech and life sciences areas are growing. ... Our cyber liability is growing.""
Brokers want to write new business, retain clients and control costs, with organic growth being the ""holy grail"" in these three areas, said Mr. Gilbertson.
Brokerages are showing a ""strong interest"" in personal lines and select commercial accounts generating less than $100,000 in premiums, said Mr. Hylant.
Mr. Cohen said IMA has initiatives in small-commercial and high-end personal lines.
From the underwriter side, there's a ""huge push"" down-market, with an emphasis on ""historically underserved"" high net worth personal lines and small-commercial business, said Hiscox's. Mr. Walter.
Tapping that market presents a huge opportunity for Hiscox, said Nicole Goodwin, chief underwriting officer.",2015,tradejournals,11-18

1. What is cyber terrorism and information warfare about?
Cyber terrorism is the premeditated, politically motivated attacks by sub national groups or clandestine agents, or individuals against information and computer systems, computer programs, and data that result in violence against non-combatant targets. It is essentially the use of cyber space for the communication and coordination of terrorist activities, the gathering of intelligence of potential targets, a force multiplier for physical attacks by disabling emergency response systems, and for causing physical harm by electronically attacking control systems for dams, electrical systems, medical databases, and a host of other computer dependent infrastructures. Information warfare is defined as a planned attack by nations or their agents against information and computer systems, computer programs, and data that result in enemy loses. The main distinction between these definitions is that cyber terrorism is about causing fear and harm to anyone in the vicinity (i.e. bystanders) while information warfare has a defined target in a war (ideological or declared).
2. Are terrorists really that skilled?
The new emerging form of terrorism uses asymmetric warfare. Threats to information systems are outside conventional warfare. Groups like al Qaeda are learning organizations that have shown their ability to use our own technology against us. They have also shown a long-term planning and preparation approach to their attacks. Many of their leadership are from middle class or better families. These people are neither ignorant nor stupid.
Remember, the leaders of the September 11th attacks went to Western universities and received masters degrees in a host of technical areas
3. Just how serious is the threat of cyber terrorism?
So much of our livelihoods now depend on the secure use of computers for communications, transportation, banking, medical, etc., and these systems have been penetrated by hackers, crackers and cyber criminals for quite some time. Imagine what would have happened if mobile phone service were disrupted just prior to a major chemical attack. Visualize having your blood type changed in a medical database before a major operation. Law enforcement is working to integrate their computer systems to provide better sharing of criminal and terrorist activities. In the past, people like Kevin Mitnik have demonstrated their ability to break into judicial and law enforcement systems and actually remove their criminal histories. Envision a cyber terrorist removing five people from a watch list hours before they board a jetliner. Imagine having your identity stolen and used to commit a terrorist act.
Enlarge this image.
4. What are the most common attacks on computer systems?
According to the CSI / FBI 2003 Computer Crime and securitySurvey, it was reported that cyber attacks occurred by Viruses (82%), unaudiorized access by insiders (45%), Denial of Service (42%), system penetrations (36%), sabotage (21%), telecom eavesdropping (6%), and active wiretapping (1%) of all participants. These percentages are based on 530 respondents in a diverse set of key industry sectors such as local, state, federal governments, transportation, telecom, utilities, medical, financial, legal, education, retail, manufacturing, and high-tech. These attacks occurred despite the fact that most of the respondents had security policies and mechanisms in place as part of their prevention and response plans. Just imagine the number of successful attacks that went unnoticed and/or unreported, and by entities that were not even part of the survey.
5. What can be done about cyber terrorism?
Security comes in three parts: protective systems such as the encryption of communications and data, mechanisms and supporting technologies; configuration and maintenance such as access controls, and proper and timely updates; and people involving policies and procedures for the proper use of systems, and general awareness and security reporting. All three must be considered to ensure your systems and networks are secured.
This can be accomplished by establishing a strong security awareness program, establishing a comprehensive security policy, creating and implementing a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, implementing the latest security technologies, conducting regular security audits, and working with law enforcement when security breaches do occur.
6. Are we at risk at home, and what can we do to secure our home computers?
More and more of us are working from home or taking work home. We store lots of personal information on our computers that can be used to steal our identities, or to penetrate and/or attack connecting systems. There are a number things that must be considered if we are going to truly secure our home systems. The physical location and protective mechanisms of the computer itself, Browser Security, Anti-Virus programs. Firewalls, E-mail Practices and Encryption, Remote Software security, Staying Backed Up & Updated, Multiple Accounts with limited permissions and child proofing, Wireless
Security, Encrypting Stored Data, and staying away from Shareware & Freeware are the primary items that need to be addressed. All of these and more are discussed in my other book in simple, easy to understand language.

4,pq_cs_newsp_5,cs media newspapers,"ALL THE BAD news about viruses, worms, spyware and other computer- security threats has been good news for Symantec Corp.
As the largest exclusive maker of computer-security software, the Cupertino, Calif., company has grabbed an outsized share of the surging interest in cybersecurity. Its stock price has been on a tear, more than doubling in the past year. That has given Symantec a market value of nearly $19 billion, making it one of the most valuable software companies in the world. And the share gains have been backed by results: In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Symantec's revenue was $618.3 million, up 44% from the year-earlier period, while profit soared 63% to $135.6 million.
Symantec is a different company from the one that John W. Thompson took over in 1999 as chairman and chief executive. Then, it was a middling provider of tools and utilities for Windows PCs, working a niche in Microsoft's ecosystem. Mr. Thompson focused Symantec entirely on security, divesting itself of unrelated product lines and replacing most of the company's management team.
In the process, the 27-year veteran of International Business Machines Corp. has become one of Silicon Valleys' most-touted CEOs. Now he's the only African-American to lead a major technology company, according to Black Enterprise magazine, which has named him corporate executive of the year.
Mr. Thompson, 55 years old, acknowledges Symantec was late to address perhaps the most aggravating problem for computer users: spyware -- programs that can monitor a user's keystrokes and steal information such as passwords. ""We took our eyes off the ball slightly,"" he said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. Yet on other fronts security experts seem to be making some progress -- as long as computer users do their part and deploy antivirus products, he say. Excerpts:
WSJ: How serious are the threats to computer security that you see and what can be done about it?
Mr. Thompson: The Internet threat environment -- hacker attacks, the propagation of worms and viruses and other types of activity like that -- has accelerated beyond our wildest imaginations of just a few years ago. On average, every week you see about 100 new viruses [detected] in our labs. You see almost 50 new software vulnerabilities every week. In the past, an attack was typically localized to the operating system; now we're seeing more vulnerabilities in more products. That's led to a level of activity in the hacker-cracker-virus-writer community that's unprecedented.
The annoying challenge we all deal with is spam. There are some forecasts that in the U.S. alone last year spam was about a $10 billion productivity hit to the economy.
The more threatening and challenging task, however, is phishing. And I don't mean fly-casting. I mean phishing for credit-card information, Social Security numbers, mothers' maiden names. Popular Web sites or popular brands are hijacked to divert unsuspecting consumers and even small businesses off to a spot where their identities can be stolen. Phishing is growing, by the latest estimates, at 110% a month -- a month.
You couple that growth rate with a 5% response rate [to e-mail sent by phishers], and you're going to see an enormous problem. It's relatively easy to do. I mean, you can cut and paste the Citigroup logo off their Web site without a whole lot of hard work. They're hijacking very, very important and powerful brands to catch your attention.
There's an important role for government right now in helping the industry at large around education and training. Always in the past there has been a very effective role for government to play when there's been some new societal danger, like forest fires, driver safety or smoking.
WSJ: You would like government to pass a law saying that we've got to buy your products?
Mr. Thompson: Absolutely not. What I don't want is for government to step in and dictate a given solution, or what strategy or what technology a company or an individual should deploy; or step in and create the false sense of hope that what they're doing is going to protect them.
A good example is the ""Can Spam"" legislation [aimed at making spam- sending illegal]. Every one of our U.S. senators and House members was able to go home last November and say, ""Yes, I voted for the spam legislation."" And the net effect of that has not changed the volume of spam traffic downward one iota. As a matter of fact, it's accelerated since then.
But there are clearly a number of places where I think industry and government can work together to do a better job. First, awareness. It is unconscionable that somebody on a broadband connection would be without antivirus protection, without a personal firewall, without some of the simple protection tools that are so readily available in the marketplace, if not from me for a fee, from someone else for free. If you can afford a $50-a-month broadband connection into your home, you ought to be able to buy a $25 product from me. You have a responsibility to protect your own assets.
Why would you ever respond to a [phishing] e-mail? That's not the way Citibank works. That's not the way Amazon works. We have to tell people, ""This is just stupid. This is not smart."" If we can't change behavior we're going to be chasing the problem with technology forever.
WSJ: What makes spyware a more insidious threat to PC users than things such as viruses?
Mr. Thompson: When a virus attacks or a worm attacks, it attacks a certain spot in the system and it's relatively easy once you have seen the pattern to identify it again and then eliminate it.
Spyware uses a slightly different technique. It distributes many little pieces of code and it embeds it in parts of your operating system, your applications and what have you. And then the task is not only to identify them but make sure you remove every single one of them. There are any number of products in the marketplace to help protect you from that. But none of them are as effective as they need to be because the state of the art is advancing as fast for the attackers as it is for those of us trying to block [them].
We took our eyes off the ball slightly. We saw banner ads and pop- ups as an issue for customers years ago and so we built products, tools, that would stop them. We got a lot of pushback from the direct- marketing organizations. The end result was we said, ""Let's not create World War Eight with the direct-marketing organizations."" So we went off and worked on spam and a number of other things. Then people realized attaching a block [of computer code] to a banner ad would be a way to hijack a user's system. It's grown exponentially. Spyware popped up a year or less ago and it's grown so rapidly that there are a dozen or more new companies in the industry trying to solve the problem.
WSJ: How much can consumers do to protect themselves?
Mr. Thompson: There is a logical three-step process that both individual and corporate users should follow. The first is to be aware. For consumers, awareness comes in the form of an alert any time there's a new virus in the marketplace, an alert that comes any time a new vulnerability is discovered, an alert that comes from Microsoft every time they want you to upgrade or patch your system.
What, unfortunately, doesn't happen is the ""act"" step, which is to push a patch, do the software update, redeploy virus signatures, on and on.
And then there's a third phase: How do I control my environment? How do I set up a real-time backup? Now that I've got my entire family photo album online, I should have some idea as to how frequently I ought to back it up. Attackers don't want to necessarily take your photo album but they wouldn't mind rendering the drive on which you have it stored inoperable.
It's not unlike living in the physical world. If you live in a gated community you don't say, ""Well, I don't need locks and alarms."" What you do is you say, ""Well, I need locks and alarms, too, depending upon the value of the assets that I'm trying to protect."" In the digital world you protect your client [PC]. You also probably hope that AOL has some scanning capability that screens all that stuff at the network level.
WSJ: What's the motivation of virus and worm creators?
Mr. Thompson: Nothing more than to say, ""I did that. There's my signature."" It's for notoriety in many instances as opposed to for some financial gain.
WSJ: How are they learning how to write viruses?
Mr. Thompson: Someone in my team could make you into a virus writer in a matter of minutes. All you have to do is go to certain sites on the Web and pull down components.
WSJ: Why do Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintoshes seem impervious to virus creators?
Mr. Thompson: Why bother? It's 2% of the market. Talk about a target-rich environment: with Microsoft there are on average 48 new vulnerabilities every week. Why do I need to putz around with Mac? Linux -- faster-growing, maybe more interesting than Mac. IPod -- maybe interesting. Cellphones -- maybe interesting. Mac? That's old stuff.
WSJ: Some of the most effective spyware-protection software is free. Is that a threat to your business?
Mr. Thompson: An organization that derives no revenue from a product and therefore has no visible means of support, how are they going to support you as the threat environment changes? It may very well be that the technology they have today is very effective today. The question is, how effective will it be tomorrow? We spend 4% to 15% of revenues on R&D. We'll generate $2.4 billion in revenue this year. We've got a visible means of support for customers as opposed to things that are free that you don't know where the support's going to come from.
WSJ: You have a good business plugging the holes in Microsoft's software. What happens to your business if Microsoft cleans up its act?
Mr. Thompson: People don't just throw away and discard the old infrastructure technologies that they have deployed. Heck, there's Windows 3.1 [a program released in 1992] in the world today. And so even if Longhorn [the next version of Windows] hits the marketplace in 2006 or 2007 and it is the greatest thing and most secure operating system in the world, we'll still have a healthy business for a long, long time to come.
WSJ: Do you recruit employees from the hacker community?
Mr. Thompson: No, we don't. We have people who are every bit as capable but they live by a moral compass or an ethical standard that is consistent with our brand. We trade on trust. And so if customers ever thought that Symantec was at the root of some of this because we've had people who didn't live by the same ethical code or moral code that we believe in, that wouldn't be a good thing.",2004,newspapers,94-04
